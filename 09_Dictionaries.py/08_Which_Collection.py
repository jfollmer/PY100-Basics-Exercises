# Which Collection? exercise in Dictionaries exercises:

# Rewrite car as a nested list containing the same key/value pairs.

car = {
    'type':  'sedan',
    'color': 'blue',
    'year':  2003,
}

# I'm not really sure what this is asking us to do. Which part is 
# supposed to be a nested list? And how does a list have key-value pairs
# since lists don't have keys and values?


# Given solution:

car = [
    ['type', 'sedan'],
    ['color', 'blue'],
    ['year', 2003],
]
