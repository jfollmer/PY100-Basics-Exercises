# Print Quote exercise in the Functions exercises:

"""Write a function that prints Bruce Eckel's quote 'Python is 
executable pseudocode.'. What is the return value of the function?

bruce_eckel_quote()

"""Since we've only defined the function to print something and not to 
return anything, the default return value is None.

# Given solution video shows a way to test the return value:
