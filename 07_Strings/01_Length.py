# Length exercise in Strings exercises:

# Determine the length of the string "These aren't the droids you're 
# looking for.".

print(len("These aren't the droids you're looking for."))   # 43


# The given solution assigns the string to a variable first:

string = "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
length_of_string = len(string)
print(length_of_string)                 # 43
