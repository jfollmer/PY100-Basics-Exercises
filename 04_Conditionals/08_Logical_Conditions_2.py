# Logical Conditions 2 exercise in the Conditionals exercises:

# Predict the output of the following code:

if True and False:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')


"""The expression on line 5 evaluates as False, because the and operator
requires both operands to be truthy. If one is falsy, it returns the 
falsy value. Therefore, the else statement executes, and 'No...' is
printed.
