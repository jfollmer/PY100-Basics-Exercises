# Logical Conditions 1 exercise in the Conditionals exercises:

# Predict the output of the following code:

if False or True:
    print('Yes!')
else:
    print('No...')


"""On line 5, the expression False or True evaluates to True, since if
either operand in an or statement is truthy, the expression evaluates as
the first operand in the expression that is truthy. Therefore, the 
following block executes, so 'Yes!' prints and the if statement is 
skipped.
